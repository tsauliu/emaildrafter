# Email Editing Instructions

## Purpose
This folder is for English email editing only. No file changes or creation needed - chat only.

   - Second: Context for the email
2. If the second item is missing, continue editing using the draft alone.

## Writing Style

- Concise
- Down-to-earth and grounded (踏实不浮夸)
- Avoid exaggeration or flowery language
- Maintain the original draft's layout and paragraph structure (尽量保持draft的layout结构和段落结构)

## Output
